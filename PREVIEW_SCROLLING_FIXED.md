# Preview Mode Scrolling - Final Fix

## Summary
Fixed preview mode scrolling to properly handle all row data display with working keyboard navigation.

## Technical Details

### Implementation
The preview mode now uses the Paragraph widget's built-in scroll functionality:
- `scroll((self.preview_scroll_offset, 0))` scrolls by logical lines
- Each column name and value is on separate lines
- Multi-line values are properly indented

### Scroll Indicator
Shows detailed scroll information in the top-right corner:
- Current line position
- Total number of lines
- Percentage scrolled
- Format: `Line 15/45 (33%)`

### Navigation Controls
- **j/↓**: Scroll down one line
- **k/↑**: Scroll up one line  
- **PageDown**: Scroll down 10 lines
- **PageUp**: Scroll up 10 lines
- **Home**: Jump to top
- **Esc/p**: Exit preview mode

## Testing Instructions

1. Create a test database with many columns:
```sql
-- Use the provided test_preview_scroll.sql file
-- This creates records with 30 columns including long text fields
```

2. Run the query and navigate to results
3. Press 'p' to enter preview mode
4. Test scrolling:
   - Press 'j' repeatedly to scroll down
   - Verify the line counter increases
   - Ensure all columns become visible
   - Test PageDown for faster scrolling
   - Press 'k' to scroll back up

## What Was Fixed
1. Removed complex line counting that included wrap calculations
2. Used simple logical line count (paragraph_text.lines.len())
3. Let the Paragraph widget handle text wrapping internally
4. Added detailed scroll position indicator
5. Used saturating arithmetic to prevent overflow

The preview mode now reliably scrolls through all column data, making it easy to view complete row information even with many columns.
