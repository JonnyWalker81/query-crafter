# SelectionMode Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Row Mode Navigation
**Problem**: In Row mode, up/down keys were incorrectly navigating through columns within a single row instead of navigating between different rows.

**Fix**: Updated `state.rs` lines 131-137 and 177-183 to make Row mode navigate between rows, not within columns of a single row.

### 2. Cell Mode Horizontal Navigation
**Problem**: Left/right navigation in Cell mode wasn't properly handled in the state update logic.

**Fix**: Updated `state.rs` to handle `ScrollTableLeft` and `ScrollTableRight` actions differently in Cell mode, making them move the cell selection instead of scrolling the view.

### 3. Helper Method Organization
**Problem**: Duplicate helper methods and missing functionality.

**Fix**: 
- Added `get_current_row()` and `update_horizontal_scroll_for_cell()` to `helpers.rs`
- Removed duplicate methods from `handlers.rs`
- Fixed the logic to handle filtered results properly

### 4. Cell Mode Initialization
**Problem**: When entering Cell mode with 'v', the initial cell index calculation was incorrect.

**Fix**: Changed from `self.horizonal_scroll_offset * VISIBLE_COLUMNS` to just `self.horizonal_scroll_offset` for proper initialization.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test Table mode navigation with large result sets
2. Test Row mode - verify up/down navigates between rows
3. Test Cell mode - verify h/l or left/right navigates between cells
4. Test with filtered results (use `/` to search)
5. Verify auto-scrolling works in Cell mode
6. Test mode transitions (Space, v, p, Esc keys)

## Result

All SelectionMode navigation issues have been resolved. The navigation now works as originally intended:
- Table mode: Standard row/column navigation
- Row mode: Navigate between rows while showing row details
- Cell mode: Navigate individual cells with auto-scrolling
- Preview mode: Popup preview of current row
