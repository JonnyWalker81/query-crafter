# Incremental Build Fix Summary

## Problem
When modifying `src/components/db.rs`, the entire project was rebuilding instead of just the affected module. This was due to:
1. `db.rs` depending on a `theme` module in the main crate
2. The theme module being imported by many files, creating a viral dependency

## Solution
We fixed this by having `db.rs` import the theme directly from the external `query_crafter_theme` crate instead of going through the internal `theme` module.

### Changes Made:

1. **In `src/components/db.rs`**:
   - Added: `use query_crafter_theme as theme;`
   - Replaced all `crate::theme::Theme::` with `theme::`
   - Fixed `Style::default().fg(theme::ERROR)` to use `theme::error()` function instead

2. **In `src/autocomplete_widget.rs`**:
   - Added: `use query_crafter_theme as theme;`
   - Replaced all `Theme::` with `theme::`

3. **Removed theme module from main crate**:
   - Deleted `src/theme.rs`
   - Removed `pub mod theme;` from `src/lib.rs`
   - Removed `pub mod theme;` from `src/main.rs`

## Result
Now when `db.rs` is modified, only the `query-crafter` binary needs to be recompiled, not the entire dependency tree. The theme is accessed directly from the external crate, breaking the dependency chain.

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
```bash
# 1. Ensure baseline build
cargo build

# 2. Test no-change rebuild (should be instant)
cargo build

# 3. Modify db.rs
echo "// Test" >> src/components/db.rs
cargo build  # Should only compile query-crafter

# 4. Revert
git checkout -- src/components/db.rs
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered
- Moving theme code into the same module as db.rs
- Creating a const-only theme module
- Using inline attributes

The direct external crate import was chosen as the cleanest solution that maintains good code organization.
