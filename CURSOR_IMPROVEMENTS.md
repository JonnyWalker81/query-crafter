# Vim Editor Cursor Improvements

## Fixed Issues
### ✅ Insert Mode Cursor Visibility
- **Problem**: In insert mode, the cursor was invisible due to only having foreground color styling
- **Solution**: Added background color (green) to insert mode cursor for clear visibility
- **Location**: `src/theme.rs` - `cursor_insert()` method

### ✅ Focus State Indication
- **Problem**: No visual indication when the vim editor has focus vs other components
- **Solution**: Added focused border styling that changes color based on component focus
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `draw_with_focus()` method to `EditorComponent` trait
  - Updated vim component to show blue borders when focused
  - Updated db component to pass focus state correctly

### ✅ Mode-Specific Cursor Styling
- **Normal Mode**: Orange background cursor (block style)
- **Insert Mode**: Green background cursor (visible and distinct)
- **Visual Mode**: Purple background cursor (selection mode)

## Technical Changes

### Theme System Updates (`src/theme.rs`)
```rust
pub fn cursor_insert() -> Style {
    Style::default()
        .bg(Self::ACCENT_GREEN)      // ← Added background for visibility
        .fg(Self::BG_PRIMARY)
        .add_modifier(Modifier::BOLD)
}
```

### Editor Component Trait (`src/editor_component.rs`)
- Added `draw_with_focus()` method with default implementation
- Allows components to receive focus state and adjust styling accordingly

### Vim Component (`src/components/vim.rs`)
- Implemented `draw_with_focus()` for proper border styling
- Ensures cursor style is updated on every draw call
- Handles focus state with different border colors

### Database Component (`src/components/db.rs`)
- Updated to use `draw_with_focus()` instead of `draw()`
- Passes correct focus state based on `ComponentKind::Query` selection

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visible Insert Cursor**: Users can now clearly see the cursor position when typing
2. **Focus Indication**: Clear visual feedback shows which component is active
3. **Mode Awareness**: Different cursor styles help users understand current vim mode
4. **Professional Appearance**: Consistent with modern TUI applications

## Testing
- Application compiles successfully with all improvements
- Cursor visibility confirmed in all vim modes
- Focus states working correctly between components
- Modern theme integration maintains visual consistency
